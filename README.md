Complete survival analysis on a dataset inherent to NSCLC data. Various extensions of Cox model adaptation.
Original paper and (open) data are available at https://www.cancerdata.org/resource/doi:10.17195/candat.2016.04.1. 
Original data consisted of two datasets (one for development, one for validation of a certain survival model) therefore, analysis has been performed upon splitting the original datasets in the two seperated ones.
